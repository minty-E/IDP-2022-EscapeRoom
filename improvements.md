# IMPROVEMENTS FOR IDP

get basic stuff down, leaderboard, hint button usage, google sheets api

some media is missing, i.e. tree images

flashing effect, not blinking? (as a result of tree, so make/fix tree assets)
have dialogue in flashes to indicate what the action is

make transition clearer? (maybe not needed)
more explanation about lore (i.e. why would your body in the real world die)

## act 1

puzzles, sound effects, backgrounds: good

transitions are lacking/do not exist

indicate puzzles clearer
maybe have more explanations for puzzles? (through dialogue or through other means, *utilize characters if possible*)

## act 2
get rid of placeholders asap
work on artifacts, fit them clearer into story/aesthetic

interactivity is good within puzzles

## act 3
not fully finished 


### overall:
pretty buggy, find all through playthroughs and try to fix
again, have more explanations for the puzzles
give either readouts of time or have physical timer/stopwatch


### if data doesnt show up:
manually write down data by clock
google form && manually writing down time
will lose some points

will packaging the game make the glitches lessen
beautiful artwork, interactivity is good

WORK ON CLOCK AND HINTS FOR POINTS
